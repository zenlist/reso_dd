    EnerPHit,

    /// "[HERS Index Score](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/HERS+Index+Score)": The HERS Index is the nationally recognized scoring system for measuring a home's energy performance. To calculate a home's HERS Index Score, a certified RESNET home energy rater will do a home energy rating and compare the data against a reference home (a design-modeled home of the same size and shape as the actual home), so the HERS Index Score is always relative to the size, shape, and type of the house. The lower the number, the more energy efficient the home.
    HERSIndexScore,

    /// "[Home Energy Score](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/Home+Energy+Score)": The Home Energy Score, managed by the US DOE, is a national system that allows homes to receive an energy efficiency rating, similar to the MPG rating available for cars. The Home Energy Score uses a 10-point scale to reflect how much energy a home is expected to use under standard operating conditions. Homes that are expected to use the least amount of energy (and are considered the most energy efficient) score a 10, and homes that are expected to use the most amount of energy (and are considered the least energy efficient) score a 1. The Home Energy Score uses a standard calculation method and takes into account the home's structure and envelope (walls, windows, foundation) and its heating, cooling, and hot water systems. Only Qualified Assessors who pass a DOE exam are allowed to provide the Home Energy Score.

    /// "[LEED For Homes](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/LEED+For+Homes)": USGBC's residential rating system, LEED for Homes, was launched in 2008. The LEED rating systems are developed through an open, consensus-based process led by LEED committees. LEED is a voluntary program that provides independent, third-party verification that a home was designed and built using methods for achieving high performance in multiple areas of sustainability including energy, water, waste management, indoor air quality, and sustainable site development. There are multiple rating systems for all types of buildings including Existing Buildings and Homes for residential projects. Homes may achieve different levels of certification (platinum, gold, silver, certified) depending on the number of LEED prerequisites and credits that are met.
